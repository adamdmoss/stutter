# stutter

Quick dumb stutter-tester aimed at linux; meant to gather statistics about how long a simulated cpu-heavyish interactive application (i.e. game) is unscheduled.

'Cos, did you know that although the Linux kernel supports preemption, practically every distro just ships kernels which are just configured to use co-operative multitasking?  Brr.
